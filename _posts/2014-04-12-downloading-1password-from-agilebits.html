<p>Passwords are a necessary evil we have to deal with in our online society. Most security breaches occur due to weak passwords, a result of people using common phrases like 1234 or password, and easily identifiable things in our daily lives.</p>
<p>What is worst is many people use the same password across all of their accounts, and when an online provider experiences a security breach, guess what? Hackers have your login information, which will probably work across everything you use&mdash;they iget to work finding out what they have access to in your world immediately after a breach.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m adopting <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password from AgileBits</a>&nbsp;to help me manage my passwords, after watching my GF and partner Audrey Watters successfully use to manage her own world. 1Password gives you a vault to store your most secure items from your daily life, including passwords, credit card numbers, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve downloaded the Mac version of 1Password, and I&rsquo;m working to go through all my account and using 1Password setup unique, generated passwords for each service I depend on. As I download the iPhone and browser tools for 1Password I will share the stories on this blog as well.</p>
